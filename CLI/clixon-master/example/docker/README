Run the ietf routing example as docker container.
Use the dockerhub container, or alternatively, build clicon as docker images
by doing make docker in the top builddir.

   (cd ..; make) # Make example
   make docker   # Create config file and shared file system
   run.sh        # Run a backend and a cli container
