# Clixon Netconf

Clixon Netconf implements the following NETCONF proposals or standards:
- [NETCONF Configuration Protocol](http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-4741.txt)
- [Using the NETCONF Configuration Protocol over Secure SHell (SSH)](http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-4742.txt)
- [NETCONF Event Notifications](http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-5277.txt)

However, it needs to be updated to RFC 6241 and RFC 6242. 

Clixon NETCONF currently does not support the following features:
